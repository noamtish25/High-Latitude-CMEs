# O. Khabarova, N. Samara, N. Tishler, H. Reshef, and C. Price. Properties of Coronal Mass Ejections at High Apparent Latitudes in 1996-2023 - SupportingÂ data

Description

This dataset contains observations of high-latitude Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from 1996 to 2023.
 
| **Column Name** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `Date` | Date of the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) event. |
| `Time` | Time of the CME onset or first observation. |
| `Central PA [deg]` | Central Position Angle in degrees, indicating the direction from the Sun's center where the CME is observed (measured counterclockwise from solar north). |
| `Angular Width [deg]` | Angular extent of the CME in degrees, representing how wide the CME appears in the plane of the sky. |
| `Linear Speed [km/s]` | Speed of the CME derived from a linear fit to the height-time data. |
| `2nd Order Speed (Final Height) [km/s]` | Speed derived from a quadratic (second-order) fit to height-time data, representing the velocity at the final observed height. |
| `2nd Order Speed (20 Rs) [km/s]` | Projected speed of the CME when it reaches 20 solar radii (Rs), based on second-order extrapolation. |
| `Acceleration [km/s2]` | Acceleration or deceleration of the CME over the observed range. |
| `Mass [g]` | Estimated mass of the CME in grams, based on brightness and density assumptions. |
| `Kinetic Energy [erg]` | Kinetic energy of the CME in ergs, calculated using the mass and speed. |
| `MPA` | Measurement Position Angle, where the CME's properties were most reliably measured. |
| `Movies/Plots & Links` | Instruments and media used to observe the CME (e.g., LASCO C2, C3, EIT 195). |
| `Remarks` | Notes about the CME event quality or special characteristics (e.g., \"Partial Halo\", \"Poor Event\"). |
| `quality` | Quality rating of the data or event, typically ranging from 1 (low) to 3 (high). |
| `movie` | Direct link to a Java movie visualization of the CME event hosted by CDAW (SOHO LASCO CME Catalog). |
